# Stellar Scale

A standalone javascript web component to display a stellar graph, as described
by Alexandre Morin-Chassé in [Off the “radar”? Here are some alternatives ](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/684-off-the-radar-here-are-some-alternatives).

The drawing is done via [two.js](https://two.js.org/) which is therefore a dependency,
for drawing the graphs and is expected to be available globally, by this lib.

See demo.html and slider-demo.html for usage.
